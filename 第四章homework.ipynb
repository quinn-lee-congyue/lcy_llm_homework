I have also, recently, been condemned to wearing one pair of running trainers *everywhere* due to a really bad knee injury combined with terrible biomechanics (read: I have bow legs). Until I can get insoles, trainers were my one and only footwear.\\n\\nBut now the sun is out, my knee is better, and I am looking at my current shoe collection thinking \\\"oh mah gah, these are all SERIOUSLY old\\\". My one pair of ballet flats for summer were \\u00a312 New Look numbers that used to be metallic gold. Now they're just off-white. My two pairs of cheap trainers (no brand) have stains on them of I don't know what. I have seen my shoes in a whole new light. A shoe lady I may never become, but hell, I NEED new shoes.\\n\\nBrief autobiography of my feety matters done, now to the review at hand. I rarely review chains, and even less frequently (in fact, this could be a first) give them the full sexy five stars. Schuh is a store I rarely frequent too. I'm not a fan of 'brands' really, and prefer boutiquey numbers. I also have ridiculously narrow feet (not small, they're just long and thin) and most shoes are like boats on me and fall off.\\n\\nBut when I stubbed my toe AGAIN in my battered gold ballet flats and realised the sole was hanging off, it happened right outside Schuh, and I took it as a sign. On wandering in I realised \\\"wow this place is big and there are a LOT of shoes\\\".\\n\\nMy only other Schuh experience was the one on North Bridge which is very small, and the two stores in Glasgow which are 'ok' but I always left disinterested.\\n\\nIt could be fashion is turning my way, or that in my new found 'I can wear non-trainers!' state of mind I saw shoes in a whole new way. But they had a lot of different brands in here, and almost all of the offerings I liked!\\n\\nThe staff were also really attentive. It was a busy Bank Holiday Monday and I did the *very* annoying customer thing of asking for one pair, and whilst the staff had run off to the stock room, seeing another pair and when they came back asking for those in my size too. I did that 5 times. By the fourth time the shop assistant looked worn but was still smiling and not rude about it.\\n\\nSo with all the shoes, and friendly staff, I just had to buy a pair. They're even a 'brand' shoe as well. I didn't feel pushed into buying anything either. Sometimes in these stores the constant \\\"can I help? can I get your size?\\\" puts me off, but I was left in peace and only asked once or twice.\\n\\nBig props to this branch of Schuh. For what it is - a chain selling branded shoes - it does it well, and it was the first High Street chain shopping store I've been in that I actually enjoyed in quite some time.\\n\\nAnd I really do quite like my new shoes.</td>\n",

But I sampled 8 items, so I think I can write an educated review.  \\n\\nI ordered the lentil soup, because it was recommended over and over again in the Yelp reviews.  Awful.  You know how those State Street middle eastern restaurants smell?  That's how this soup tastes.  Over-seasoned, over-purreed (did not see an actual lentil), and stinky.  Every person at my table mentioned the bad smell.  \\n\\nI moved onto the Mediterranean plate (the entree).  Here's the breakdown:\\n- Tabouli: Inedible.  Soaking in salt and vinegar, tasted like pickle juice.\\n- Grape leaves: Inedible.  Tasted like tobacco!\\n- Baba Ganouj: Inedible.  Not sure why.  Just tasted awful.\\n- Falafel: Okay, but I've had better at the Great Dane.  That tells you something.\\n- Hummus:  Passable, but this cannot be the best in Madison (as the other reviews say).  I can go into Whole Foods and blindly choose any hummus and it would be better.\\n- Tahini dip:  No flavor!  It literally tasted like water, if that makes any sense.\\n- Pita slices: Nothing special.\\n\\nAnd at $13.95, it was overpriced as well.

How can you go wrong when the word \\\"Super\\\" is in the name of your burger.  I am from New Mexico and you will notice that there is a topping called green chiles.  Don't confuse this with jalapenos.  This is the real deal and I think it is actually hatch green chile.  My wife always gets the coney dog.  Sonic was also one of the first fast food place to serve breakfast all day.  I don't really like eating in the car but we have 2 small children and it's kind of easy when they are strapped in their seats.  So if you haven't had a Sonic burger you are missing out.

In fact, when my hubby picked me up for lunch and surprised me by taking me to this little hidden restaurant, I was a wee bit nervous about finding something on the menu I would like. Instead, I just returned to my office, handed my co-worker the menu, insisted she go eat there for lunch, and sat down to write this review. Yup, it was THAT good. \\n\\nWhen we walked in, we were greeted by Areeya who informed us that the salads and pizzas (on gluten free crust) were something that were favorited by most since we were new to the place. So, that's exactly what we got, a half House Salad with the House dressing and a full Traditional Pizza. We got our salad first and it was a smorgasbord of fresh veggies (avocado, bell pepper, cucumber, mixed greens, sprouts) and nuts mixed with the house dressing which tasted fresh and garlicy. Then came the pizza, which the menu claims is 'unlike any you've ever had'... and this is why that statement is true: The gluten free crust isn't a thin piece tasteless cardboard like one would expect, it is a thick, delicious, buckwheat crust that was the perfect consistency for piling on the delicious pesto marinara, basil, cauliflower, almonds, &amp; walnuts. The flavors were extraordinary! \\n\\nI'm not a total health nut and I'm definitely not a vegan but this place serves up DELICIOUS healthy food and I cannot wait to return to try more items from the menu.\\n\\nTIP: If you're ordering for lunch, call ahead and place your order - It did take a little while to get the food.</td>\n",
